## Grape Harvesting Robot (Graduate Thesis)

This repository contains all implementations as input for grape harvesting robot using ***[Image Processing + Clustering](https://github.com/huynhloc04/LVTN/tree/main/Grape_OpenCV)*** or ***[Deep Learning](https://github.com/huynhloc04/LVTN/tree/main/Vision_WS)*** methods.

We also deploy all codes (Deep Learning model) to edge device. It is Jetson Nano (B01)

In this project, we use a stereo camera IMX219-83 to take input images and the most important is to calculate the coordinates (X, Y, Z) in real world from the camera to the objects (grapes) using *"stereo vision"*
